# SQL Overview for Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a movie rental company, is venturing into the online video rental service domain to remain competitive against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. As a data analyst in Rockbuster's Business Intelligence (BI) department, our primary task is to leverage SQL (Structured Query Language) for data analysis. SQL allows us to query Rockbuster's extensive database, enabling us to provide data-driven insights to support strategic decision-making.

## Key Questions and Objectives

Rockbuster's Management Board has posed critical business questions, ranging from revenue analysis to customer insights, that require data-driven answers. By harnessing SQL, we aim to address these questions comprehensively. Our objectives include identifying top-performing movies, analyzing rental duration, understanding customer demographics, and exploring sales variations across geographic regions.
